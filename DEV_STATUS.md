- ❌ **Collaboration**: No sharing or collaborative features

### Quality Assurance
- ❌ **Testing Infrastructure**: No unit/integration/e2e tests
- ❌ **Performance Benchmarking**: No systematic performance testing
- ❌ **Accessibility Testing**: No WCAG compliance verification

## 🚨 Critical Issues Resolved

1. **Module Import Errors**: Fixed Next.js compatibility issues with export libraries
2. **Generation Algorithm Bugs**: Fixed parameter mismatches in generation functions
3. **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error boundaries and user feedback
4. **Map Integration**: Resolved OpenLayers integration and drawing tools
5. **Shapefile Export**: Implemented working shapefile export with @mapbox/shp-write
6. **GeoJSON Import Issues**: Fixed callback function mismatch in uploader component
7. **Boundary Generation Errors**: Fixed FeatureCollection handling for uploaded boundaries
8. **Radio Button Auto-selection**: Fixed viewport mode incorrectly switching to draw mode
9. **Clear Features Functionality**: Added comprehensive feature clearing capability

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Week 1: Export System Completion ✅ **MOSTLY COMPLETED**
1. ✅ **Replace problematic export libraries** with browser-compatible alternatives
2. 🔄 **Test export functionality** with various dataset sizes
3. [ ] **Add CSV export** for attribute-only data

### Week 2: AI Integration
1. **Implement basic prompt parsing** for common patterns
2. **Add contextual attribute generation** based on geometry type
3. **Create template system** for common use cases

### Week 3: Performance & Polish
1. **Implement Web Workers** for large dataset generation
2. **Add progress indicators** for long-running operations
3. **Optimize map rendering** for large feature sets

### Week 4: Testing & Documentation
1. **Set up testing infrastructure** (Jest, React Testing Library)
2. **Create user documentation** and tutorials
3. **Performance benchmarking** and optimization

## 📊 Technical Metrics

### Current Capabilities
- **Generation Speed**: ~1000 features/second (estimated, needs benchmarking)
- **Memory Usage**: Unknown (needs profiling)
- **Supported Formats**: 2/3 (GeoJSON & Shapefile working, GeoPackage disabled)
- **Browser Compatibility**: Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Performance Targets
- **Generation Speed**: <5 seconds for 1000 features
- **Memory Usage**: <500MB for 50,000 features
- **Export Speed**: <10 seconds for 10,000 features
- **Map Rendering**: 60fps interaction with 5,000+ features

## 🔮 Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Core functionality is stable and working
- UI/UX is complete and polished
- Basic export functionality operational

### Medium Risk
- Export library compatibility issues (solvable)
- Performance optimization needs (addressable)
- AI integration complexity (manageable)

### High Risk
- No testing infrastructure (quality risk)
- No performance benchmarking (scalability risk)

## 💡 Recommendations

1. **Focus on export system completion** - This is the main blocker for full MVP
2. **Implement basic AI features** - This is the key differentiator
3. **Add testing infrastructure** - Critical for quality assurance
4. **Performance optimization** - Needed for production readiness

## 🎉 Conclusion

The Geomockery project is in excellent shape with a solid foundation and most core features working. The remaining work is primarily about completing the export system, adding AI intelligence, and ensuring production readiness through testing and optimization.
